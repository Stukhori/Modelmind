# ModelMind: 
# AI-Powered Excel Data Financial Analyst
# Project Description

ModelMind is a web application built with Python and Flask that acts as an intelligent data analyst for your Excel files. 
Users can upload an Excel spreadsheet, ask a question in plain English, and receive a detailed answer generated by Google's Gemini AI or Chat-Gptâ€™s AI.
The application analyzes the uploaded data, and answers the user's question to provide insightful, context-aware responses.
